Intro (Scene 1: Welcome)  
"Welcome to the presentation of myLife+App, a social platform designed to merge private communication with curated public engagement. Created by **David Odelana** and **Chimaobi Ubani**, this app combines the intimacy of WhatsApp with the engagement of Twitter, but tailored for privacy and community. Let’s explore how it works."

Scene 2: Core Features
1. **User Authentication**:  
   "Users start by registering or logging in securely. The app ensures data privacy with encrypted passwords and session management."  

2. Navigation:  
   "The interface has a clean, intuitive layout. On the left, a navigation column lets users switch between:  
   - AI Tools: For smart interactions.  
   - Messages: Direct and group chats.  
   - Status: 24-hour disappearing updates.
Reels - to store permanent reels   
   - Channels: Public spaces for organizations or celebrities.  
   - Feeds/Posts: A mix of posts from contacts and followed channels."  

3. Header Actions:  
   "At the top, users can search for contacts or channels, toggle dark mode, and access settings like notifications and profile edits."

Scene 3: Key Functionality 
1. **Status Updates**:  
   "Users upload photos or videos as statuses visible for 24 hours. A circular thumbnail gallery displays recent statuses from contacts."  

2. **Private Messaging**:  
   "A middle column shows active chats. Clicking a chat opens a real-time conversation in the main feed. Messages are encrypted for security."  

3. **Public Channels**:  
   "Users follow channels (e.g., sports clubs, news outlets) to see their updates in their feed. Channels are public but require subscription."  

4. Hybrid Feed:  
   "The main feed combines:  
   - **Private posts**: Shared only with the user’s contacts.  
   - **Channel posts**: Public updates from followed channels.  
   Posts are sorted chronologically, with options to like or comment."

Scene 4: Technical Implementation
1. **Current Tech Stack**:  
   "The prototype uses **Flask** (Python) for backend logic, **SQLite** for data storage, and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. User authentication and session management are handled by Flask-Login."  

2. **Future Plans**:  
   "Post-prototype, the app will migrate to **Node.js** for scalability and integrate **MongoDB** for flexible data handling. Real-time features like chat will use **Socket.io**."  

3. **Unique Challenges**:  
   "Balancing privacy (contact-only posts) with public channel content required careful feed-filtering logic. Dark mode and responsive design ensure accessibility."

Scene 5: User Workflow Demo  
1. **Registration**:  
   "A new user signs up with a username and password. The system redirects them to their profile."  

2. **Adding Contacts**:  
   "From the navigation panel, users search for friends and add them to their contact list."  

3. **Posting**:  
   "In the feed section, a user types a post and selects visibility: ‘Contacts Only’ or ‘Public Channel’. The post appears instantly in their feed."  

4. **Joining a Channel**:  
   "The user navigates to ‘Channels’, browses a list (e.g., ‘Tech News’), clicks ‘Join’, and the channel’s posts populate their feed."  

---

Scene 6: Future Vision  
1. **Phase 1**:  
   "Integrate **Node.js** for backend efficiency and **React** for a dynamic frontend."  

2. **Phase 2**:  
   "Launch mobile apps (iOS/Android) and add AI chatbots for user support."  

3. **Phase 3**:  
   "Monetize through sponsored channels and premium subscriptions for advanced features."

### **Outro (Scene 7: Closing)**  
"Thank you for exploring **myLifeApp**! By blending private interactions with curated public engagement, we aim to create a safer, more personalized social experience. For questions or collaboration, contact David Odelana or Chimaobi Ubani. Together, let’s redefine connectivity."

### **Notes for Delivery**:  
- **Pacing**: Pause between scenes for clarity.  
- **Tone**: Friendly and enthusiastic.  
- **Alt Text for UI**: Describe buttons, icons, and layouts (e.g., "A dark mode toggle button in the top-right corner").  
- **Key Highlight**: Stress the app’s unique hybrid model (private + public).
